Here are some important points about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++:

1. **Classes and Objects**:  
   - **Class**: Blueprint for creating objects.  
   - **Object**: Instance of a class.

2. **Encapsulation**:  
   - Bundles data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class).  
   - Access modifiers: `public`, `private`, and `protected` control access.

3. **Inheritance**:  
   - Enables a class (child) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent).  
   - Promotes code reuse.

4. **Polymorphism**:  
   - Allows a single function or operator to behave differently based on context.  
   - Achieved through **function overloading**, **operator overloading**, and **virtual functions**.

5. **Abstraction**:  
   - Hides unnecessary details and shows only the relevant functionality.  
   - Implemented using abstract classes and interfaces.

6. **Constructors and Destructors**:  
   - **Constructor**: Special function called automatically when an object is created.  
   - **Destructor**: Special function called when an object is destroyed.

7. **Static Members**:  
   - Shared among all objects of a class.  
   - Can be accessed without creating an object.

8. **Friend Functions and Classes**:  
   - Allow non-member functions or classes to access private/protected members of a class.

9. **Virtual Functions and Polymorphism**:  
   - Support runtime polymorphism with **virtual** and **override** keywords.

10. **Operator Overloading**:  
    - Redefines operators for user-defined types to work in a custom way.

11. **Templates**:  
    - Enable generic programming by writing code that works with any data type.  

OOP in C++ provides powerful tools for building modular, maintainable, and reusable code.
